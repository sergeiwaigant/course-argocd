# **Application Health Assessment in ArgoCD**

ArgoCD provides robust health assessment capabilities to monitor the status of applications and their associated resources. This section covers **Health Status Definition**, **Customizing Health Checks**, and **Troubleshooting Health Issues**.

---

## **Health Status Definition**

ArgoCD evaluates the health of Kubernetes resources and aggregates their statuses to determine the overall health of an application. Each resource type has specific criteria for assessing its health, which is reflected in one of the following statuses:

1. **Health Statuses**:
   - **Healthy**: The resource is functioning as expected (e.g., all replicas are updated for a Deployment).
   - **Progressing**: The resource is being updated or scaled but has not reached the desired state.
   - **Degraded**: The resource is not functioning as expected (e.g., failed pods or missing replicas).
   - **Suspended**: The resource is intentionally paused (e.g., a suspended Job).
   - **Missing**: The resource defined in Git does not exist in the cluster.
   - **Unknown**: The resource's health cannot be determined due to insufficient information.

2. **Built-in Health Checks**:
   - Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, DaemonSet: Check if observed generation matches desired generation and replicas are updated.
   - Service (LoadBalancer): Verify that `status.loadBalancer.ingress` contains valid IPs or hostnames.
   - PersistentVolumeClaim: Ensure `status.phase` is `Bound`.
   - Ingress: Validate `status.loadBalancer.ingress`.

**Summary**:
- **Health Statuses**: Healthy, Progressing, Degraded, Suspended, Missing, Unknown.
- **Resource-Specific Checks**: Deployment replicas, LoadBalancer ingress, PVC binding.
- **Application Health Aggregation**: Based on immediate child resource statuses.

## **Customizing Health Checks**

ArgoCD allows users to define custom health checks for resources that do not have built-in checks or require specific criteria. Custom checks are written in Lua scripts and configured in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap.

Refer to the documentation for further reference: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/

1. **Custom Health Check Configuration**:
   - Add custom checks under the `resource.customizations` field in `argocd-cm`.
   - Example for a certificate resource:
     ```yaml
     data:
       resource.customizations.health.cert-manager.io_Certificate: |
         hs = {}
         if obj.status ~= nil then
           if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
             for _, condition in ipairs(obj.status.conditions) do
               if condition.type == "Ready" and condition.status == "False" then
                 hs.status = "Degraded"
                 hs.message = condition.message
                 return hs
               elseif condition.type == "Ready" and condition.status == "True" then
                 hs.status = "Healthy"
                 hs.message = condition.message
                 return hs
               end
             end
           end
         end
         hs.status = "Progressing"
         hs.message = "Waiting for certificate"
         return hs
     ```

2. **Testing Custom Health Checks**:
   - Use test YAML files and Lua scripts to validate health checks locally before applying them.

3. **Advanced Customization**:
   - Configure parent-child relationships so that a parent resource’s health reflects its children’s statuses when necessary.

**Summary**:
- **Custom Checks via Lua Scripts**: Define in `argocd-cm`.
- **Example Use Case**: Certificates or custom CRDs.
- **Testing Custom Checks**: Validate scripts locally before deployment.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Enable inheritance of child statuses if needed.

## **Troubleshooting Health Issues**

When applications or resources show degraded or unknown health statuses, troubleshooting involves identifying root causes using ArgoCD tools and logs:

1. **Common Issues**:
   - Missing resources: Verify Git repository manifests and ensure synchronization.
   - Failed deployments: Check pod logs and events for errors (e.g., image pull failures).
   - Configuration drift: Investigate differences between live state and desired state using the ArgoCD UI or CLI.

2. **Troubleshooting Tools**:
   - ArgoCD CLI commands:
     ```bash
     argocd app get <app-name> --refresh
     argocd app diff <app-name>
     ```
   - Kubernetes commands:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <app-name>
     kubectl logs <app-name>
     ```
   - Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for monitoring application metrics.

3. **Advanced Debugging Techniques**:
   - Use ArgoCD's sync history to identify changes causing issues.
   - Enable verbose logging for deeper insights into synchronization failures.

4. **Restoring Application Health**:
   - Perform manual synchronization to correct drift:
     ```bash
     argocd app sync <app-name>
     ```
   - Rollback to previous versions if updates cause degradation:
     ```bash
     argocd app rollback <app-name> [ID]
     ```

**Summary**:
- **Common Issues**: Missing resources, failed deployments, configuration drift.
- **Troubleshooting Tools**: CLI commands (`app get`, `app diff`), Kubernetes logs.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
- **Restoration Techniques**: Manual sync or rollback.

## Final Notes

ArgoCD's health assessment features provide visibility into application states while enabling customization to fit specific requirements. Troubleshooting tools ensure quick resolution of issues, maintaining application stability and reliability in production environments.
