# **Managing Application Updates with ArgoCD**

ArgoCD provides robust features for managing application updates, including **Rollback Capabilities**, **Version Control Integration**, and **Progressive Delivery Concepts**. Below is a detailed explanation of these topics.

## **Managing Application Updates**

1. **Update Process**:
   - Updates are typically triggered by changes in the Git repository.
   - ArgoCD monitors the repository for updates and syncs them to the Kubernetes cluster based on the configured sync policy.
   - Use `argocd app patch` to make targeted updates to application configurations without a full sync:
     ```bash
     argocd app patch myapp --patch='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/source/targetRevision", "value": "new-branch"}]' --type json
     ```

2. **Sync Strategies**:
   - **Automatic Sync**: Ideal for development environments where rapid iteration is necessary.
   - **Manual Sync**: Suitable for production environments where changes need to be carefully reviewed and tested before deployment.

## **Rollback Capabilities**

ArgoCD allows you to easily roll back to previous versions of an application if issues arise after an update. This is achieved by leveraging the Git history and ArgoCD's ability to track revisions.

1. **Rollback Process**:
   - Use the `argocd app history` command to view previous revisions.
   - Roll back to a specific revision using `argocd app rollback`:
     ```bash
     argocd app history myapp
     argocd app rollback myapp [ID]
     ```

2. **Benefits**:
   - Fast recovery from failed updates.
   - Ensures application stability by reverting to known good states.

## **Version Control Integration**

ArgoCD integrates seamlessly with version control systems like Git. This integration allows you to manage application configurations and track changes over time.

1. **GitOps Principles**:
   - Git serves as the single source of truth for application configurations.
   - Changes are versioned, making it easy to track updates and roll back if needed.

2. **Benefits**:
   - Auditable changes: All updates are tracked in Git.
   - Collaboration: Multiple teams can manage different parts of the application configuration.

## **Progressive Delivery Concepts**

Progressive delivery involves gradually rolling out updates to a subset of users before deploying them fully. The Argo project supports progressive delivery through features like **Canary Releases** and **Blue/Green Deployments**.

Note: Refer to Argo rollouts for this concepts as this is not part of ArgoCD itself.

- https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/bluegreen/

1. **Canary Releases**:
   - Deploy a new version to a small subset of users.
   - Monitor performance before rolling out to the entire user base.

2. **Blue/Green Deployments**:
   - Run two versions of the application side-by-side.
   - Gradually shift traffic from the old version to the new one.

3. **Tools and Integrations**:
   - Use tools like Argo Rollouts for more advanced progressive delivery strategies.
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate the rollout process.

## **Summary**

- **Application Updates**: Triggered by Git changes; use `argocd app patch` for targeted updates.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Use `argocd app rollback` to revert to previous versions.
- **Version Control Integration**: Git as the single source of truth for configurations.
- **Progressive Delivery Concepts**: Canary releases and Blue/Green deployments for gradual rollouts.

These features enable efficient management of application updates while ensuring stability and reliability in production environments.
