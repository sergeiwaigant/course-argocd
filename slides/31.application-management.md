# **Creating and Managing Applications in ArgoCD**

ArgoCD enables you to define, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications declaratively using GitOps principles. This section covers the **application definition and structure**, the **Application CRD in Kubernetes**, and the concept of **Projects in ArgoCD**.

---

## **Application Definition and Structure**

In ArgoCD, an application is a collection of Kubernetes resources that represent a workload or service. Applications are defined declaratively using YAML manifests stored in Git repositories. These manifests describe the desired state of the application, including deployments, services, and configuration maps.

**Key Components of an Application Definition**:
- **Source**: Specifies the Git repository URL, branch/tag, and path to manifests.
- **Destination**: Defines the Kubernetes cluster (API server) and namespace where the application will be deployed.
- **Sync Policy**: Determines how synchronization is handled (manual or automatic).

Refer to the documentation for full reference: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-specification/

**Example YAML for an Application**:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/example/repo.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: app-directory
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

**Summary**:
- **Source**: Git repository URL, branch/tag, path to manifests.
- **Destination**: Target cluster and namespace.
- **Sync Policy**: Manual or automated synchronization.
- **Declarative Approach**: Applications are defined as YAML manifests.

## **Application CRD in Kubernetes**

ArgoCD uses a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) called `Application` to represent applications. This CRD extends Kubernetes' API to include ArgoCD-specific features such as syncing with Git repositories and monitoring application health.

**Key Features of the Application CRD**:
1. **Declarative State Management**:
   - The `Application` CRD defines both the desired state (from Git) and live state (in the cluster).
   - ArgoCD continuously monitors these states for drift.

2. **Sync Mechanism**:
   - The `syncPolicy` field defines whether changes are applied automatically or manually.
   - Supports rollback to previous versions if issues arise.

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Includes health checks for deployments, pods, and services.
   - Reports status as Healthy, Degraded, or OutOfSync.

4. **Multi-Tool Support**:
   - Works with Helm charts, Kustomize overlays, Jsonnet files, and plain YAML.

**Summary**:
- **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**: Extends Kubernetes API for ArgoCD applications.
- **Desired vs Live State**: Continuously monitored for drift.
- **Sync Mechanism**: Manual or automated updates.
- **Health Monitoring**: Reports application health status.

## **Projects in ArgoCD**

Projects in ArgoCD allow you to group and manage multiple applications under a single umbrella. They enable better organization, access control, and resource management across teams or environments.

**Key Features of Projects**:
1. **Access Control**:
   - Define which Git repositories can be used by applications within a project.
   - Restrict destination clusters and namespaces for deployments.

2. **Isolation and Security**:
   - Projects isolate applications from one another to prevent accidental cross-environment changes.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) can be applied at the project level.

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Limit resource usage (e.g., CPU/memory) for all applications in a project.
   - Centralize configuration for shared settings like secrets or environment variables.

4. **Default Policies**:
   - Set default sync policies, health checks, and other configurations for all applications within a project.

Refer to the documentation for full reference: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/project-specification/

**Example YAML for a Project**:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: dev-project
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  sourceRepos:
    - https://github.com/example/repo.git
  destinations:
    - namespace: dev
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  clusterResourceWhitelist:
    - group: "*"
      kind: "*"
```

**Summary**:
- **Purpose of Projects**: Grouping applications for better organization.
- **Access Control**: Restrict repositories, clusters, and namespaces.
- **Isolation & Security**: Prevent cross-environment changes.
- **Centralized Policies**: Default settings for all project applications.

## Final Notes

These concepts—application definition, Application CRD, and projects—are foundational to managing Kubernetes workloads with ArgoCD. They provide flexibility while adhering to GitOps principles of declarative configuration and automation.
